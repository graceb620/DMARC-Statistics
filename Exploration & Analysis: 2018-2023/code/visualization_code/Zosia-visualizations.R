# Visualize the Proportion of First-Time Pantry Visits by Household Type

# Message: Shows the proportion of first-time visitors with and without children.
# Why itâ€™s useful: Helps identify trends in household demographics, informing decisions on how to allocate resources and address needs.
# Audience: Stakeholders who make decisions about DMARC's future operations.
